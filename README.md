# Title: Taskly

# Description: 
Taskly is a website designed to help individuals efficiently track 
their tasks in just one place. Users simply need to input a few details 
about their tasks and then watch as our website creates a detailed and organized 
to-do list in just a few seconds. It includes features that allow users to filter
tasks based on specific details, receive reminders for upcoming due dates, 
and access a built-in Pomodoro timer for better productivity. 

# Outline:

# Description of the JS Incorporation:
In developing our website, JS will be used to manipulate HTML elements 
so that we are able to add/remove HTML elements and access inputs from the user 
by using .innerHTML or .value which will enable a more dynamic and interactive website. 
JS will also be used to create animations and effects that could make the website more visually 
appealing and engaging for the users who are interested in the website. Additionally, 
Javascript will be used to handle events caused by the user (clicking, pressing a key and hovering) 
using event handlers such as onclick, onmouseover, onchange, and many more. Using event handlers, we 
can specify the things that should be done when the user clicks a button or when the pages 
load/close. The use of JS functions (predefined and user defined)  and arrays will also be helpful 
in developing our website since there are parts in our website that will require the use of functions,
to make the code more readable and easier to debug, and arrays, to make it easier to handle large sets o
f values that will be used in other parts of the program. Using JS, we will also incorporate loops so that
we can iterate various commands and to traverse through arrays.
